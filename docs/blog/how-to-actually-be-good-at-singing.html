            <h1>How to Actually Be Good At Singing</h1>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>
                Before we start:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>What makes someone "good" at singing?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                You might think to be good at singing you would follow all of the classic singing tips like these:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sing from your diaphragm</li>
                <li>Have proper posture</li>
                <li>Relax your lips, jaw and tongue</li>
                <li>Singing voice should reflect talking voice</li>
                <li>Singing should be healthy and gentle on vocal cords</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But there are plenty of examples of very popular singers who don't do this.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not from diaphragm (eg, Tonight Tonight, or Bullet with Butterfly Wings)</li>
                    <li>Likely didn't even think about his posture or relaxing anything</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bob Dylan</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>He broke all of the singing tips</li>
                    <li>He sang with a completely different voice on <i>Nashville Skyline</i> (singing voice doesn't
                        have to reflect talking voice)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>John Mayer</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Didn't relax his mouth (just watch some old videos and see how tense his mouth/entire face is)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Patrick Stump (Fall Out Boy)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For their first album he didn't sing from diaphragm, and was really nasally</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Adam Duritz (Counting Crows)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not relaxed (sometimes sounds like he's in pain while singing)</li>
                    <li>Sometimes stutters while he sings (at least live)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Stevie Wonder</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gets really nasally (not relaxing his nose), doesn't always sound like singing from diaphragm
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Elliott Smith</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nasally and sounds like he's holding back (not using diaphragm)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Elton John</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Had to have surgery due to stress on vocal cords</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tom Waits</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's no need for any explanation here</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The list can go on and on and on.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are all really convincing singers in their own ways,
                but they all blatantly violate classic singing advice (and therefore accepted singing technique).
            </p>

            <p>
                All of these examples and evidence is enough for me to say:
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    These widely accepted singing tips are not just wrong.
                    They are damaging to anyone who wants to be good at singing.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing that all the vocalist above have in common isn't their vocal technique. It is that
                they put on a convincing and meaningful act.
            </p>

            <p>
                And by "good act" I mean that in the sense of the vocalist being an actor.
            </p>

            <p>
                So to be a good singer: learn how to act.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throw out vocal technique, and use acting tips and techniques:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Read, listen, and watch others sing</li>
                <li>Know your character</li>
                <li>Know your lines</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                And if there were just one rule it would be: <b>be convincing.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                It doesn't even matter how you make yourself convincing. You could whisper, you could sing, you could
                scream, you
                could breath into a microphone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just don't waste your time thinking you aren't relaxed enough, you're not using your diaphragm, or
                it's your
                posture.
            </p>
